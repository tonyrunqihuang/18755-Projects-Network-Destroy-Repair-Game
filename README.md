====

Project Info:
- Project Name: Network Destroy Repair Game
- Group member: Tony Huang, Vikas Kashyap

Project Description:
- This is Python implementation for Network Destroy-Repair Game.

Hyperparamters:
- Network: there are four available networks, including social network, p2p network, autonomous system network and email networks.
- Algorithm: attack and defense algorithms can be random or smart
- Number of iterations (niter): number of time steps an experiment is expected to perform
- Number of nodes (nnodes): number of edges that a random algorithm selects for removal

## Usage

```python main.py```
